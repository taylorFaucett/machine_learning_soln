    "I've tried to structure this jupyter notebook as cleanly as I could so that it is easy to follow different approaches I've tried. Also, for every model I trained I have stored a copy (as a pickle file) in the director `models`. This will allow you to see results without the need to personally re-train the models. For some methods (e.g. Neural Networks), the training time is quite long (especially without a dedicated GPU) so loading the model will be quick.\n",
